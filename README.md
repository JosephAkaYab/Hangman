# Hangman
v1.0.1
- Refactored scaling code
- Moved word lists to txt files (txt files must be in the same directory as the exe)
- Other minor changes

v1.0.0
- If you can think of any imporvements please let me know
- The resizing code is almost certainly wrong but it works
- I will probably make the program get the word arrays from a text file at a later date
